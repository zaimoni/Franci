<br/>i.e. Context for Godel&rsquo;s Completeness and Incompleteness theorems</h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_system">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_system</a></p>
<p>A formal system can be denoted by:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A finite set of symbols, i.e. alphabet.</li>
	<li>A grammar specifying rules for forming well-formed finite sequences
		(formulas) from simpler well-formed finite sequences of symbols
		from the alphabet.  It is very useful (and often required) to have
		a decision procedure for whether a finite sequence,
		is a well-formed formula.</li>
	<li>A set of axioms, or axiom schemata,
		consisting of well-formed formulas.</li>
	<li>A set of inference rules.  Theorems are defined
		as well-formed formulas, that are inferrable from the axioms.</li>
</ul>
<p>A formal system is said to be:</p>
<ul>
	<li>recursive (alternately, effective) if the set of axioms and
		the set of inference rules are decidable (the algorithm recognizing
		the axioms, and the algorithm recognizing the inference rules,
		both terminate in finite time both when the proposed finite sequence
		does, and does not, match)</li>
	<li>recursively enumerable if the set of axioms and
		the set of inference rules are semidecidable (the algorithm recognizing
		the axioms, and the algorithm recognizing the inference rules,
		both terminate in finite time when the proposed finite sequence
		does match; does not have to terminate when it does not match.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Typical logical symbols for an alphabet include</p>
<ul>
	<li>The universal and existential quantifiers.</li>
	<li>Logical symbols for &ldquo;and&rdquo;, &ldquo;inclusive or&rdquo;,
		&ldquo;not&rdquo;, &ldquo;implies&rdquo;, and
		&ldquo;if and only if&rdquo;.</li>
	<li>Various kinds of punctuation.</li>
	<li>An infinite set of variables; suffixing (e.g, with integers)
		is an option.  Their values are in the domain of discourse.</li>
	<li>Equality = may be considered either a logical symbol, or
		a non-logical predicate symbol.</li>
	<li>Truth values.</li>
</ul>
<p>Typical non-logical symbols are generally either</p>
<ul>
	<li>n-ary predicates, that evaluate to truth values.  A 0-ary predicate is
		a propositional variable that can be substituted out for any statement.</li>
	<li>n-ary functions, that evaluate to objects in the domain of discourse.
		A 0-ary function is a constant symbol.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_completeness_theorem">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_completeness_theorem</a></p>
<p>Fixing a deductive system (e.g., classical logic):</p>
<p>We say that a sentence s of a theory T:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Is a syntactic consequence T&#9500; s , if and only if
		s is provable from T .</li>
	<li>Is a semantic consequence T&#9566; s, if and only if s holds
		in every model i.e. interpretation M of T .</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic</a></p>
<p>Terms (symbols that evaluate to an object in the universe of discourse)
	and formulas (symbols that evaluate to a truth value)
	may be recursively defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Any variable, is a term.</li>
	<li>Any n-ary predicate, taking a non-negative integer n terms,
		is a formula.</li>
	<li>Any n-ary logical connective, taking a positive integer n formulas,
		is a formula.</li>
	<li>For any formula &phi; and variable x, the quantified statements
		<span style="transform:rotate(180deg);display:inline-block">A</span>x &phi; and
		<span style="transform:rotate(180deg);display:inline-block">E</span>x &phi; are formulas.</li>
	<li>Any n-ary function symbol f, taking a non-negative integer n number
		of formulas or terms as arguments, is a term.
		<ul>
			<li>This is atypical, but needed to be able to denote
				a step function in first-order logic.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>Bound and free variables in formulas are defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>There are no bound variables in any atomic formula;
		a variable x is free in an atomic formula &phi;,
		if and only if x occurs in &phi;</li>
	<li>For any n-ary logical connective, a variable x is free or bound
		in that connective, if and only if x is free or bound
		in at least one formula of that connective.</li>
	<li>For formulas <span style="transform:rotate(180deg);display:inline-block">A</span>x &phi; and
		<span style="transform:rotate(180deg);display:inline-block">E</span>x &phi;, a variable
	<ul>
		<li>y is free if and only if y&lt;&gt;x and y is free in &phi;</li>
		<li>y is bound if and only if y=x or y is bound in &phi;
		<ul>
			<li>We do not mention free variables in the definition of bound
				variables, and vice versa, so that the definitions work as
				expected in nonclassical logics.</li>
		</ul></li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Specific formal systems may introduce additional base case formulas with comparable definitions of bound and free variables (e.g.,
	the class operator in Von Neumann-Bernays-G&ouml;del set theory).
<p>A formula in first-order logic, that contains no free variables,
	is called a first order sentence.  These are the formulas for which
	it is reasonable to expect them to evaluate to truth values.</p>
<p>If a sentence &phi; evaluates to true for a given interpretation M
	of a theory T, we say M satisfies &phi; ; symbolic denotation is
	M&#9566; &phi; .  A sentence &phi; is satisfiable if there is
	at least one interpretation i.e. model M for which &phi; is true.</p>
<p>A formula that does contain at least one free variable, may be defined
	to be satisfiable if it is true when any element of
	the universe of discourse is substituted for the free variable.
	Whether this definition is useful, is context-sensitive.</p>
<p>A formula &phi; is said to be (logically) valid, if it is true
	in every interpretation i.e. model M.  (This is closely related
	to semantic consequence T&#9566; &phi; .)</p>
<p>A formula &phi; is said to be a logical consequence of a formula &psi;,
	if every interpretation that makes &psi; true also makes &phi; true.</p>
<p>&hellip;.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-order_logic">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-order_logic</a></p>
<p>In (full) second-order logic, we allow variables that range over
	k-ary relations (where k is a positive integer).  Monadic second-order
	logic only uses variables that range over 1-ary relations, i.e. sets.</p>
<p>Standard semantics is the &ldquo;naive&rdquo; generalization of
	first order logic to second order logic; Henkin semantics involves
	domain restrictions for the second-order logic specific variables,
	compared to standard semantics.</p>
