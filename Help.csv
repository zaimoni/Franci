	Arity	0
	Description	Franci removes unused reasoning from the logfile at Franci.htm.
Constraint	Usage	constraint: [statement]
	Arity	1
	Description	Franci adds the statement to the current situation.\n'Constraint: [statement]' causes terse logging.
end logfile	Usage	end logfile

	Description	Franci closes the logfile at Franci.htm.
evaluate	Usage	evaluate [expression]
		what is [expression]
	Arity	1
	Description	Franci evaluates the specified expression.
		'Evaluate [expression]' and 'What is [expression]' cause terse logging.
evaluate situation	Usage	evaluate situation
	Arity	0
	Description	Franci evaluates the current situation.
		'Evaluate situation' causes terse logging.
new situation	Usage	new situation
	Arity	0
	Description	Franci starts a new situation.  The prior one is forgotten.
new variable	Usage	new variable: [quantified variables]
	Arity	1
	Description	Declare variables with specified domain and quantification.
no more variables	Usage	no more variables
	Arity	0
	Description	Franci disables further explicit and implicit declaration of variables in the current situation.
start logfile	Usage	start logfile
	Arity	1
	Description	Franci starts a logfile at Franci.htm.  She truncates any previous logfile.
use script	Usage	use script [filename]
	Arity	1
	Description	Franci reads in and executes the commands in the file referenced by filename.
what if	Usage	what if [expression]
	Arity	1
	Description	Franci considers how the situation would evaluate if she assumes [expression].  She also checks for proof-by-contradictions.
		'what if TRUE' will elicit checking for proof-by-contradictions on the current situation	 after evaluating it.
		'What if [expression]' causes terse logging.
what is	AliasFor	evaluate
auxilliary connectives	Usage	A IMPLIES B
		A NIMPLIES B
	Arity	2
	Description	Franci automatically rewrites these reserved words to their definitions.
		A IMPLIES B is defined as NOT A OR B
		A NIMPLIES B is defined as A AND NOT B
NOT	Usage	NOT A
	Arity	1
	Description	Reserved word denoting logical negation.
		NOT TRUE is FALSE
		NOT FALSE is TRUE
		NOT UNKNOWN is UNKNOWN
		NOT CONTRADICTION is CONTRADICTION
IMPLIES	AliasFor	auxilliary connectives
NIMPLIES	AliasFor	auxilliary connectives
infix connectives	Usage	A AND B
		A OR B
		A IFF B
		A XOR B
		A NXOR B
		A NIFF B
		A NOR B
		A NAND B
	Arity	2
	Description	AND, OR, and IFF are defined as usual.
		A XOR B is defined as A IFF NOT B
		The A N___ B forms are defined as NOT (A __ B)
prefix connectives	Usage	AND(A,B,...)
		OR(A,B,...)
		IFF(A,B,...)
		XOR(A,B,...)
		NXOR(A,B,...)
		NIFF(A,B,...)
		NOR(A,B,...)
		NAND(A,B,...)
	Arity	2 or more
	Description	AND, OR, IFF are defined as usual.
		XOR ("exclusive or") is defined as usual for arity 3 or higher.
		XOR(A,B) is defined as IFF(A,NOT B)
		The N___(A,B,...) forms are defined as NOT ___(A,B,...)
equality predicates	Usage	ALLEQUAL(A,B,...)
		ALLDISTINCT(A,B,...)
		A DISTINCTFROMALLOF B,C,...
		A EQUALTOONEOF B,C,...
		NOTALLDISTINCT(A,B,...)
		NOTALLEQUAL(A,B,...)
	Arity	2 or more
	Description	ALLEQUAL: all arguments are equal
		ALLDISTINCT: all arguments are distinct (pairwise not equal)
		DISTINCTFROMALLOF: A is distinct from all of the other arguments
		EQUALTOONEOF: A is equal to at least one of the other arguments
		NOTALLDISTINCT: at least one pair of arguments is equal
		NOTALLEQUAL: at least one pair of arguments is distinct
